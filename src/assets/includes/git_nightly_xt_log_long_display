Auto-load patch on keyboard browsing through patch search results (#8076)

* Auto-load patch on keyboard browsing through patch search results

Previously, presets would have loaded only when clicking entries via mouse, or when pressing Enter and option "Retain patch search results after loading" enabled.

This is a lot better now.

Renamed that option so that it's clear it only matters when mouse clicking the search results.
