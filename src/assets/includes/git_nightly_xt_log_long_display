Fix soft takeover failing after patch load (#8068)

Previously, soft takeover was unaware that the knob has changed its value after a patch was loaded.
Now, with a single line of code (at least for all float params, which is all we really care about here), they do, and soft takeover will work for MIDI learned parameters after a patch load (previously, it would just jump, as if soft takeover wasn't enabled).
