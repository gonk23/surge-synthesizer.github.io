Some minor build clarifications in README.md (#8063) (#8064)

* Building an Installer: Windows also needs 7-zip's 7z.exe file in the path.
* Setting up for Your OS: For Windows, go to Visual Studio Installer and install "Desktop development with C++" from the "Workloads" tab.
* Setting up for Your OS: For Linux, add cmake and git to the sudo apt install command.
